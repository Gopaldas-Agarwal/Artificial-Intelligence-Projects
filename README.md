# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
Implementation of basic AI concepts such as searching and FOL resolution to solve problems. 

---The Projects---
Fruit Rage - A game Playing Agent using alpha-beta pruning.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)


Inference Engine - FOL resolution system.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic))


Searching - Basic state Space search strategies to solve a modified version of N-Queens.
Strategies used - BFS(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), DFS(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and Simulated Annealing(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).
